# some-ZNO-statistics
This repo contains a little research that tests hypothesis about the shortest test options. (Take a look at `is-shortest-wrong.ipynb`)

Another files:
* `dataset.csv` - ZNO in ukrainian language and literature 2006-2020 years tasks 
* `webscrapper.py` - script that was used to collect that data. I prefer not to say what site I used to collect data, so `config.py`
file required to start this script is not provided. If you know the site url you can recreate it by yourself.
